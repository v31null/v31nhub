 *                             PROPERTIME LOGIC
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This library implements a historically and astronomically flawless time
 * system based on the English calendar transitions and the exact sidereal day,
 * spanning back through Egyptian, Sumerian, and Deep Stonehenge chronologies.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. THE TIME SYSTEM (01-60 MIN/SEC, 00 HOURS)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Minutes and seconds run from 01 to 60, NEVER 00.
 * Why? Because they derive from the Latin "pars minuta prima" (first small part)
 * and "pars minuta secunda" (second small part). Because they represent active,
 * physical "laps" or fractions of ongoing time, there is no "zero" lap.
 *
 * Hours, however, represent COMPLETED units of time. Therefore, the hour
 * starts at 00.
 *
 * Example Start of Day: 00:01:01 AM
 * Example Noon Alignment: 11:60:60 AM (Strictly representing Non-standard 11:59:59 AM,
 * leading into 00:01:01 PM)
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2. THE EXACT DAY (SIDEREAL TIME & NO DRIFT)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A true standard day is exactly 86,400 seconds long. To maintain the classical
 * 11:57 quirk without suffering from solar drift, the 57th minute of the
 * final hour acts as a massive "leap minute" that absorbs all remaining seconds.
 * Instead of ending at 11:57:04 PM, the final minute runs until 240 seconds:
 *
 *       --> 11:57:240 PM
 *
 * Upon the very next second, it snaps directly to 00:01:01 AM of the next day.
 *
 * Leap seconds are natively inserted:
 * - Mathematical 11-day cycle leap seconds (ending at 11:57:241 PM).
 * - Official scientifically added leap seconds — extend it further.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 3. HISTORICAL CALENDAR ERAS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The timeline tracking spans seamlessly across deep history:
 *
 * ERA 0: Deep Stonehenge (JDN < -93407114)
 *   - The astronomical Neolithic computer. Years do not exist here.
 *   - 1 Lap = 56 Julian Years (Exactly 20,454 Days, tracking lunar standstill).
 *   - 1 Hole = 1 Julian Year (~365.25 Days, tracking solar cycles).
 *   - ANCHORED TO TODAY'S SKY: the whole deep-time count is pinned to the present.
 *     Because the 56 Aubrey Holes were a lunar instrument, Hole 1 / Lap 1 / Day 1 is
 *     set to the most recent major lunar standstill: the moment the Moon's mean node
 *     crossed 0 degrees Aries, on 29 January 2025 (JDN 2460705). Every ancient hole,
 *     lap and day is extrapolated backwards from that fixed point, so the 18.6-year
 *     standstill phase matches the real sky exactly for the present. The zero point is
 *     the standstill, not a solstice, so each Hole's day count begins at the node
 *     crossing rather than at midsummer - the way the Neolithic builders used the ring.
 *     The Lap and Hole are mean Julian cycles (56 x 365.25 = 20,454 days): exact near
 *     the anchor, drifting slowly across deep time, since the tropical year is not
 *     365.25 days and three nodal cycles total 55.83 years, not 56. The reverse
 *     conversion takes its phase from the same anchor, so changing the Egyptian epoch
 *     (which shifts the era boundary) leaves the conversion exact.
 *
 * ERA 1: Sumerian King List (JDN -93407114 to 707685)
 *   - Maps 261,430 years of early Kings (ALULIM to LUGAL-KITUN).
 *   - 360-day years composed of twelve 30-day months.
 *   - SOURCING METHODOLOGY: We are trusting the scribe of the Weld-Blundell Prism 
 *     (WB-444, c. 1800 BCE) over other inscriptions for these exact numbers. 
 *     We do this because WB-444 provides the most complete, intact sequence compared
 *     to MS Su2.
 *     While the later Uruk I kings (the 7 rulers after Bilgameš) lack archaeological 
 *     evidence and possess mathematically suspicious, realistic reigns (unlike their 
 *     mythically inflated predecessors), they were engineered by ancient scribes as 
 *     chronographic "gap-fillers" to seamlessly bridge Uruk to Ur. By trusting WB-444 
 *     as written, we respect their original intent and maintain a continuous, unbroken 
 *     mathematical coordinate system, rather than attempting a modern archaeological 
 *     reconstruction that would leave a 140-year hole in the timeline.
 *   - NOTE: This implementation utilizes the Sumerian Administrative Calendar,
 *     which was strictly designed for kings and the clergy, not the agricultural 
 *     farmer's calendar. 
 *   - NOTE: This format is a extrapolation intended to closely approximate 
 *     historical reality. While the literal terminology may differ from their exact language, 
 *     a Sumerian cleric of that era would likely recognize and understand the core 
 *     structural properties of the years mapped here.
 *
 * ERA 2: Egyptian Sothic Calendar (JDN 707686 to 1460919)
 *   - 365 days exactly. 12 months, 3 seasons (AKHET, PERET, SHEMU).
 *   - Days grouped cleanly into 10-day Decans (DEC).
 *   - Ends with 5 wandering epagomenal days (A.V. - Annus Vagus).
 *
 * ERA 3: Ancient Roman / Republican (JDN 1460920 to 1704986 [Pre-45 A.C.])
 *   - Transitions at JDN 1460920 (713 A.C.).
 *   - The ancient 10-month calendar. January and February do not exist.
 *   - December absorbs remaining days (culminating in 46 A.C. with 445 days).
 *
 * ERA 4: 45 A.C. to 1154 (N.S. - The Julian Standard)
 *   - Julius Caesar introduces New Style (N.S.).
 *
 * ERA 5: 1155 to 1751 (O.S. - The English Lady Day Shift)
 *   - England shifts New Year to March 25th, reverting to Old Style (O.S.).
 *   - Year 1154 becomes 448 days long.
 *
 * ERA 6: 1752 to Present (N.S. - Return to Sanity)
 *   - Wipes 11 days: 1752 09/02 11:57:240 PM jumps to 1752 09/14 00:01:01 AM.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 4. OLD TURKIC 12-ANIMAL CALENDAR
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WARNING: The Old Turkic format is an alternate linguistic overlay, not an 
 * isolated era standard. This means it actively calculates continuously across 
 * the entire timeline. You can legitimately extract Old Turkic 
 * translations for ancient A.C. dates.
 * 
 * - Animal Years (12-year cycle): BIČIN (Monkey), TAKAGU (Rooster), WT (Dog), TONGUZ (Pig),
 *   SIČKAN (Rat), UD (Ox), BARS (Tiger), TABWȘKAN (Rabbit), LU (Dragon), YILAN (Snake),
 *   YUNT (Horse), KONY (Sheep).
 * - Months: ARAM (1st), IKINTI (2nd), UEČUENČ (3rd), etc.
 * - Units: YWL (Turkic Year), AY (Turkic Month), KUEN (Turkic Day).
 * - Output via .toAltFormats()[10] (Turkish Runic) and [11] (English Translation).
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 5. ABBREVIATIONS & TERMINOLOGY
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A.C. = Ante Christum (Before Christ).
 * A.D. = Anno Domini (In the Year of Our Lord). There is NO Anno Domini support printed after
 *        the A.C. era ends. Positive years are simply raw numbers.
 * O.S. = Old System / Old Style.
 * N.S. = New System / New Style.
 * A.V. = Annus Vagus (Wandering Year - Egyptian Epagomenal Days).
 * DEC  = Decan (10 Days) in Egyptian era, Decade (10 Years) in Roman/Modern eras.
 * YWL / AY / KUEN = Turkic Year, Month, Day respectively.
 * LAP / HOL = Stonehenge astronomical units (20,454 days and 365 days).
 * Month 90 = Winter (Dies Hiberni) - uncounted gap days before 713 A.C.
 * Month 91 = Mercedonius (Intercalaris) - Roman priest leap-month.
 * Month 92 = Intercalaris Prior (Caesar's 46 A.C. extra month).
 * Month 93 = Intercalaris Posterior.
 * Z = Zulu time. 
 * J = Japan time.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 6. DON'Ts
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - DON'T ASSUME minutes and seconds start at 00. They are strictly 01 to 60.
 * - DON'T ASSUME midnight/noon is 12:xx AM/PM. It is strictly 00:xx AM/PM.
 * - DON'T ASSUME this is not a solar clock. It is. Noon is strictly when the sun is at its zenith.
 * - DON'T ASSUME a day is 86,400 seconds (24 hours). A day is exactly 86,164
 *   seconds, properly absorbed at the end of the day.
 * - DON'T ASSUME the calendar shift happened in 1582. We follow the
 *   English civil calendar (September 1752).
 * - DON'T ASSUME years are zero-padded to 4 digits. Years are dynamic length.
 * - DON'T ASSUME chronological linearity. Days disappear (1752), months
 *   overlap (1154/1155 Lady Day), and ancient months literally do not exist.
 * - DON'T ASSUME days never exceed 31. Ancient intercalary months stretch wildly.
 * - DON'T ASSUME days are strictly sequential. They skip abruptly.
 * - DON'T ASSUME the year started on January 1st always.
 * - DON'T ASSUME Month 01 is always January. Before 45 A.C., it's Martius.
 * - DON'T ASSUME time is 9 hours ahead of UTC. System is the UTC. Greenwich Mean Time is
 *   9 hours behind UTC. Center of Time-keeping is Akashi Municipal Planetarium.
 * - DON'T ASSUME there is a Year 0. 1 A.C. jumps to Year 1.
 * - DON'T ASSUME leap seconds only happen when modern scientists say so.
 * - DON'T ASSUME the parser reads left-to-right. It reads right-to-left.
 * - DON'T ASSUME an input of 00:01:00 AM is valid. 00 seconds rolls back time.
 * - DON'T CONFUSE A.C. with A.D. A.C. is Ante Christum.
 * - DON'T ASSUME the system is purely based on one calendar. It's a continuous proleptic bridge.
 * - DON'T ASSUME AM/PM stands for Before/After Midnight. Ante/Post Meridiem (Midday).
 * - DON'T ATTEMPT to parse the 1154 transition without O.S./N.S. suffixes.
 * - DON'T ASSUME Ianuarius and Februarius exist all the time. Before 713 A.C.
 *   the winter was a nameless void dumped into Month 90.
 * - DON'T ASSUME you must use separate formats for deep time. The .toAltFormats()
 *   handles Stonehenge, Sumerian, Egyptian, Turkic, and Modern extraction.
 * - DON'T TRY to get Pre‑era by A.C. tag, Înainte Pozitiv tag serves it for a while
 *   before switching.

 * 7. USAGE MANUAL
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * [A] INITIALIZATION
 *   let now = propertime();                           — Grabs current local time (JST baseline)
 *   let past = propertime("19390101000101AM");        — Specific exact time
 *   let ancient = propertime("450101000101AM A.C.");  — A.C. time
 *
 *   Offsets and Daylight Saving Time (DST):
 *   let shifted = propertime(null, "M3", true);       — Grabs time with UTC+6 (JST-3) + DST
 *   - param2 (off_set_japan): String. "M" = minus. "3" = 3 hours. Fractionals allowed
 * 	 (e.g., "3F1TO2" for +3.5 hrs, "M1F1TO4" for -1.25 hrs).
 *   - param3 (is_day_time_saving): Boolean. If true, adds exactly 1 hour (3600s) to the resulting time.
 *
 *   String Format required for parsing:
 *   [Year][Month][Day][Hour][Min][Sec][AM/PM][Optional Suffixes]
 *   - Month, Day, Hour, Min MUST be parsed as exactly 2 digits each.
 *   - Sec is normally 2 digits, but CAN be 3 digits during the 11:57 PM daily leap minute (e.g., 240).
 *   - Year is variable length, read from right-to-left.
 *   - Suffixes supported: "A.C.", "O.S.", "N.S."
 *   - A.C. gets precedence over O.S./N.S. if both are present.
 *
 * [B] TIME TRAVEL (ADDING/SUBTRACTING)
 *   Use the .add() method. Negative numbers go backward in time.
 *   
 *   let nextDay = past.add(1, "DAYS" );
 *   let lastSec = past.add(-1, "SEC");
 *
 * [C] OUTPUTTING DATA & THE `is_he` FLAG
 *   All output methods accept an optional `is_he` boolean flag (Holocene Era / 12k calendar).
 *   If `is_he = true`, it adds exactly 10,000 years to the astronomical year.
 *   It retains all canonical suffixes (like A.C., O.S., N.S.). If the date precedes 1 H.E.
 * 	 (10,000 B.C.), it falls back to the canonical Sumerian or Stonehenge format.
 *   
 *   Let's assume 'past' is 2000 B.C. (A.C.):
 *   past.toString(is_he);
 *   // false: "2000 01⁄01 00:01:01 AM A.C."
 *   // true:  "8 001 01⁄01 00:01:01 AM A.C."
 *
 *   past.getMeta(is_he);
 *   // false: { displayYear: "2000", suffix: " A.C." }
 *   // true:  { displayYear: "8 001", suffix: " A.C." }
 *
 *   past.toAltFormats(is_he);
 *   // Returns an array of exactly 20 formatted strings.
 *   // You extract them like: let turkic = past.toAltFormats()[10];
 *   // Assuming 'past' is 1939 Jan 1st 00:01:01 AM:
 *   [0] "1939/01/01"                        				(YYYY/MIN/DD)
 *   [1] "1939 01/01"                        				(YYYY MIN/DD)
 *   [2] "19390101"                          				(YYYYMMDD)
 *   [3] "193911"                            				(YYYY[m][dy] - no pad)
 *   [4] "1939011"                           				(YYYY[MIN][dy] - padded month)

 *
 * [D] FORMAT
 * Format is ab ovo designt to flow as big→small. Different formats ,
 * e.g./ dd.MIN.yyyy or MIN/dd/yyyy can be achieved by array indexing.
 *
 * [E] MUSTN'Ts & STRICT LIMITATIONS
 *   1. [MUSTN'T EXPECT AUTO-DST]: Daylight saving is a political delusion.
 * 	 If you want to participate in the delusion, you must manually signal the system by passing true.
 * 	 Otherwise, we remain in JST purity, Japan Standard Time is the universal baseline of this
 * 	 system and DOES NOT see DST. The engine will NEVER automatically shift the clock for daylight
 * 	 saving. You MUST explicitly pass `true` to the `is_day_time_saving` parameter, or manually
 * 	 script the addition/removal of hours using `off_set_japan`. 
 *   2. [MUSTN'T USE '00' FOR MINUTES/SECONDS]: Unlike standard computer clocks (`00` to `59`),
 * 	 our minutes and seconds strictly range from `01` to `60`. Do not attempt to parse or inject
 * 	 a `00` minute/second into the string.
 *   3. [MUSTN'T ASSUME 60-SECOND MINUTES]: While most minutes are 60 seconds, the daily
 * 	 leap-minute at `11:57 PM` expands to up to 240/241 seconds to absorb the sidereal shift.
 * 	 Do not assume 60 seconds is a hard ceiling.
 *   4. [MUSTN'T LOOK FOR YEAR 0]: There is no Year 0. The calendar steps directly
 * 	 from `1 A.C.` to `1 A.D.`. Mathematical additions across the BCE/CE boundary naturally skip zero.
 *   5. [MUSTN'T FEED 24-HOUR STRINGS]: The parser mandates a 12-hour format string and always
 * 	 requires an explicit `AM` or `PM` attached to the very end of the string.
 * 	 We only speak in AM/PM, but you must do it my way.
 *   6. [MUSTN'T USE '12' FOR NOON/MIDNIGHT]: The hours of `12 AM` and `12 PM` do not logically exist.
 * 	 Hours represent completed units of time, meaning the first hour of a cycle strictly starts at `00`.
 * 	 Standard `12:00:00` noon is  mapped and aligned via `11:60:60`.
 *   7. [MUSTN'T EXPECT LEFT-TO-RIGHT PARSING]: Because the year length is  unbounded and dynamic
 * 	 (stretching back to deep Stonehenge epochs), the timestamp string is parsed strictly right-to-left.
 * 	 You must not assume fixed-length, zero-padded years like `YYYY`.
 *   8. [MUSTN'T ASSUME UTC IS THE CENTER OF TIME]: The system defines JST (Akashi Municipal Planetarium)
 * 	 as the universal chronological baseline. We do not add 9 hours to UTC, rather; Greenwich Mean Time is
 * 	 considered 9 hours behind the true baseline.
 *   9. [MUSTN'T ASSUME JANUARY IS MONTH 01]: Chronological history is not static. Before `45 A.C.`, Month 01
 * 	 is strictly *Martius* (March). Before `713 A.C.`, January and February do not  exist, and
 * 	 winter is a nameless void dumped entirely into Month 90.
 *   10. [MUSTN'T EXPECT THE 1582 GREGORIAN SHIFT]: We follow the English Lady Day shift and the subsequent
 * 	 civil standard. The timeline wipes 11 days abruptly in September 1752. Do not attempt to map
 * 	 the Catholic 1582 calendar corrections to this system.
 *   11. [MUSTN'T USE 'A.D.' SUFFIXES]: The timeline only acknowledges `A.C.` (Ante Christum) for negative years.
 * 	 There is absolutely no `A.D.` allowed or printed for positive years; they are handled purely as raw positive integers.
 *   12. [MUSTN'T PANIC AT 400-DAY YEARS OR 60-DAY MONTHS]: Calendar linearity is a myth. Year 1154  is
 * 	 448 days long. Ancient intercalary months (Months 90, 91, 92, 93) stretch wildly.
 * 	 Do not hardcode a cap of 31 days for a month or 366 days for a year if You want to support Pre-1900s, else; do not care.
 *   13. [MUSTN'T OMIT SUFFIXES ON AMBIGUOUS YEARS]: When interacting with transition periods (like the Lady Day overlap in 1154/1155),
 * 	 you must not leave the parser guessing. `O.S.` (Old Style) and `N.S.` (New Style)
 * 	 suffixes are  mandatory to resolve chronological overlaps.
 * 	 14. [MUSN'T THINK NEW IS NEW] N.S. or O.S. is depending on what Julius Ceasar's reform did
 *	 and-not what people did, N.S. of J.C. was in use until 1154 of Lady-day, then It switched to O.S..
 *   15. [MUSTN'T ASSUME SP IS THE NORMAL]: The standard space (SP) and standard hyphen-minus are not
 * 	 the baseline. The system expects the Non-Breaking Space (NBSP, \u00A0) and the
 * 	 Non-Breaking Hyphen (\u2011) as the universal default for all chronological formatting. You must
 * 	 treat standard breaking characters as fallback approximations.
 *   16. [MUSTN'T THINK A.C. IS FOR 1]: It Literally means Ante-christum, not "Before Year 1".
 * 	 Non-negative A.C.s do, & will, exist.
